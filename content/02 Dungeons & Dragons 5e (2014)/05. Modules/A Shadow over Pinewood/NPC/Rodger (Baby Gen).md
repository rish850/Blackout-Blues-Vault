Half-elven 16 year old teen, who ran away from home 2 years prior. Extremely weird. Speaks in a mix of common, elven, and archaic elven. 

Occupation: runaway
Goal: food and long-term shelter
Attitude: scared, but brave face, defensive 
Stakes: he may need to move back into the forest, which, with Boyg in there, scares him shitless
