The High Forest, also known as the Great Everwood, was a remnant of the days of old, when all of Faerûn was covered in green and elves, giants and dragons ruled the world. The forest was a vast region of old forest growth bounded by the Nether Mountains in the north and the High Moor to the south. To the west was found the Evermoors and to the east the vast desert of Anauroch. The eastern border of the High Forest lay against Delimbiyr Vale through which flows the Delimbiyr River.

What lay within this deep forest was somewhat of a mystery, and few traveled there to explore its depths. The more notable locations in the forest included the majestic Star Mounts — providing the headwaters of the Unicorn Run and the Heartblood River; the Lost Peaks in the northwest that form the headwaters of the Dessarin River; the fabled Grandfather Tree; the Dire Wood in the east; as well as many dungeons ruins, abandoned settlements, and mysterious locales. It was recorded as being over 500 miles (800 kilometers) in length from the north near the foothills of the Nether Mountains to the south near Secomber and covered nearly 20% of the lands of what called the "Savage Frontier", so it was considered the greatest forest in Faerûn.

The southern slopes of the legendary Star Mounts contained the Endless Caverns, which were said to be home to dragons and passageways that connected to the Underdark. To the south of the caverns was the Stronghold of the Nine, an abandoned dwarven site. As of the late 14th century DR, it was claimed by elves.

East of High Forest was Upvale, a small stretch of the Delimbiyr Vale that separated it from the Far Forest.

# Locations

## Forests

- [[Golden Vine Grove]]: Jack's and Gen'dai's place of birth. A hidden, and probably very old druid grove under the wing of archdruid Kelethyr.

## Settlements

- [[Pinewood]]: a bustling market village at the edge of the forest, that once a year hosts a week-long Yule festival, celebrating the year’s bountiful harvest with a collection of games, stores and performances.
