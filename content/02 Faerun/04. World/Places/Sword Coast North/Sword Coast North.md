The Sword Coast North was a region on the northwestern coast of Faerûn. While it comprised a rough landscape of rugged hills, precarious mountain ranges and dense forests, it was home to several like-minded towns and cities. The most prominent of these cities banded together with nearby allies to form the Lords' Alliance, which united much of the region well into the late 15th century DR. This vast region of the North stretched all the way from the Spine of the World in the north, south to the great metropolis of Waterdeep. It was bordered on the west by the coastland of the Sea of Swords and along the east by the Long Road.

# History

The first great realm to appear in the region known as the Sword Coast North was that of Illefarn. The kingdom of Illefarn was a contemporary of Netheril, consisting of both dwarves and elves. Illefarn survived the Fall of Netheril, until the elves left for Evermeet. Northlanders and other humans began migrating into the region a few years before the Year of Sunrise, 1 DR.
